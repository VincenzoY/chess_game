# Chess Game

Chess game coded in Processing for my Computer Science 10 Course. The assignment was an open ended final assigment to show proficency in skills learned over the course and the the ability to apply those skills. 

I created a chess game with the appropriate moving rules in chess as well as a free board mode in which pieces can be moved freely.
